# Project Summary
The objective of this project is to build a Cryptocurrency Coins Visualizing Application.

The data is fetched from coinmarketcap.com API and displayed on a table. After loading, the application displays every coin
by its name, rank, price and change in price(%).
* Users can filter the table by inserting letter by letter, the application will then display the coins which have
the matching letters in their names. This was done by using onkeyup property.
* Users can also sort the table (asc and desc) by clicking on the table heads. By default, the data is sorted by rank in
ascending order.
* If users try to sort data while filtering, the filtered data (which is being displayed) will be sorted
